Welcome to the personal website of **Armin Moradi**, a passionate Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist based in Montréal, QC, Canada. 

## About Me

I am currently a Machine Learning Intern at [CEIMIA](https://www.ceimia.org/), Québec’s leading organization in the responsible development of artificial intelligence. I am also a Research Master's student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), the Quebec AI Institute, where I am a member of the EQUAL Lab, focusing on Fairness and Cultural alignment in Recommender Systems.

Prior to my bachelor's, I used to worked as a data scientist for less than two years. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology and I also previously interned at Technical University of Munich. Beyond AI, I geek out over Jazz and Persian Regional music, where I engage in creation and improvisation.
