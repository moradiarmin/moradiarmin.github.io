Welcome to the personal website of **Armin Moradi**, a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist based in Montréal, QC, Canada. 

## About Me

I am currently a Machine Learning Intern at [CEIMIA](https://www.ceimia.org/), Québec’s leading organization in the responsible development of artificial intelligence. I am also a Research Master's student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), the Quebec AI Institute, where I am a member of the EQUAL Lab, focusing on Fairness and Cultural alignment in (Music) Recommender Systems.

Prior to my master's, spent less than two years in industry by working as a data scientist. I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, during which I also interned at Technical University of Munich to work on music and AI. 

Beyond work, I geek out over Jazz and Persian Regional music, where I engage in creation and improvisation. I have a very organizational approach towards music, so I make a lot of playlists. You can take a look at my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/s9og1jb7snat4upiudp5lml45?si=29f6d1893aa6415b) account.
