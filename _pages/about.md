Welcome to my little personal space! It's me, **Armin**. I'm an AI practitioner based in Montréal, Quebec.  

Bienvenue dans mon petit espace personnel ! C'est moi, Armin. Je suis un praticien de l'IA basé à Montréal, Québec.

### About Me

I am currently a Machine Learning Intern at [CEIMIA](https://www.ceimia.org/), Québec’s leading organization in the responsible development of artificial intelligence. I am also a Research Master's student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), the Quebec AI Institute, where I am a member of the [EQUAL Lab](https://gfarnadi.github.io/student.html), focusing on Fairness and Cultural alignment in Recommender Systems.

Before starting my master's, I spent nearly two years in the industry working as a data scientist. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I also interned at the Technical University of Munich, working on music and AI.

Beyond work, I geek out over Jazz and Persian Regional music, where I engage in creation and improvisation. I have an organizational approach towards music, so I make a lot of playlists. You can take a look at my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/s9og1jb7snat4upiudp5lml45?si=29f6d1893aa6415b) account.
